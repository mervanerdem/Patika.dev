# Insertion-Sort-Project

## A project for Algorithm task from Patika.dev course

### [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

'Task 1' Write the stages of the array.

    [22,27,16,2,18,6]  22 <-> 2
    [2,27,16,22,18,6]  27 <-> 6
    [2,6,16,22,18,27]  16 Stable 
    [2,6,16,18,22,27]  22 <-> 18
    
'Task 2' What is the Big-O of this array.

    O(n^2)
    
'Task 3' After the sorting array, what is case of 18?

> - Time Complexity
>   - Average case: The element we are looking for is in the MIDDLE.
>   - Worst case: The element we are looking for is in the END.
>   - Best case: The element we are looking for is in the START.

### [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

'Task 1' Write the first 4 stages of the array.

    [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
    [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
    [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
    [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
    [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
